Create a DB with the following structure:

name:

cli_social_media
tables:

hackers
columns:
id (PK)
alias (varchar)
password (varchar)
exploits
columns:
id (PK)
content (text)
user_id (FK)
Pre-populate the data with some hackers (these are the users of the system).

Setup a GitHub repository and local git repository to track work being done
Create a python script that achieves the following:
Allows a user to log in (find a matching username and password combination)
If the login fails, the user should not be shown the options!
Once logged in, presents the user with 4 options:
Enter a new exploit (these are like posts)
See all of their exploits
See all other exploits by everyone except for the logged in user
Exit the application
The user should be able to re-pick each time (the options should be in a loop)
Make sure each SQL interaction is supported with the appropriate exception catching.
 

When submitting, please dump the DB to a file and put that in your git repo and make sure you push that as well!

Remember DO NOT PUSH THE DBCREDS FILE.

 

BONUS:

Give users the ability to sign up. 
They should be able to enter a username and password and have it stored.

Give users the ability to modify an exploit that belong to them. 
This can be a new option 
(they will need to be able to pick the exploit they will want to modify)

For option 3, show the username of the hacker that owns the exploit as well 
as the exploit when printing.
